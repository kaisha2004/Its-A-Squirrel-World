# Project Overview

## Central Park Squirrel Trivia

## Project Description

Have you ever wondered why does it seem like the squirrels in Central Park are having so much fun? This mobile app is to unlock your inner squirrel (Come on we all have one!) and allow you to play along with your favorite furry animals. 

This app offers users the opportunity to learn about the activities of squirrels in Central Park and have fun while doing it. We will ask users to guess the total sightings of squirrel activities while giving random facts so they're appreciation for squirrels will grow each time the game is played.
